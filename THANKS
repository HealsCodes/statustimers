Thanks go out to the following people from Ashita's discord for sharing their
insight and support without which this addon wouldn't have been possible in 
the first place.

Thorny - For writing the original statustimers plugin and sharing details
         on how to calculate status durations and for the required signatures.
         And also for being awake early in my weird timezone.

atom0s - For finding and sharing the signatures required to toggle visibility
         of the in-game status icons as well as providing the v4 Addon SDK.

Shinzaku & ðŸ¦† - For sharing their experience with ImGui shenanigans.

#developers for keeping up with my banter and sometimes really dumb questions.
